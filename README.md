Overview
This project implements a secure authentication mechanism using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Refresh Tokens in .NET 8
The approach follows Clean Code principles and leverages a service-oriented architecture to keep the authentication process modular and maintainable

Key Features

JWT Token Authentication: Securely authenticate users and issue access tokens
Refresh Tokens: Allow the user to stay authenticated without constantly re-entering credentials
Separation of Concerns: Authentication logic is encapsulated in services for better readability and maintainability
